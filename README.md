# Brackets
I have three iterations to solve this code challenge in Iterations.cs.
The first iteration is a get-it-done approach.
The second iteration focuses on cleaning up the if logic in the loop.
The final iteration simplifies the switch and uses LINQ for the loop operation.

This project is setup with .net 6 and xunit tests.
